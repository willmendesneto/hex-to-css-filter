## [Unreleased][]

## [5.1.0][] - 2021-08-08

### Fixedq

- Fixing issue when passing a key to be removed from cache that doesn't exist. Before the fix, if the consumer was passing a non-existent key, all the cached values were removed. Now, if a non-existent key is passed through the cache won't be changed

### Updated

- Adding JSDocs for `clearCache` method
- Adding `.lintstagedrc` configuration file
- Applying changes to decrese bundle size to 2.2KB ðŸŽ‰

## [5.0.0][] - 2021-08-07

### Updated

- Updating NodeJS version to v14.15.5
- Upgrading dependencies and devDependencies

### Added

- Adding `clearCache` function to removed values from memory cache. It also gives the option of clear all cached values from memory.

```ts
// Creating CSS filters for `#24639C` and `#FF0000`
// They memory cache stored is based on the received hex value
const [firstResult, secondResult, thirdResult, forthResult] = [
  hexToCSSFilter('#24639C', { forceFilterRecalculation: false } as HexToCssConfiguration),
  hexToCSSFilter('#24639C', { forceFilterRecalculation: false } as HexToCssConfiguration),
  hexToCSSFilter('#FF0000', { forceFilterRecalculation: false } as HexToCssConfiguration),
  hexToCSSFilter('#FF0000', { forceFilterRecalculation: false } as HexToCssConfiguration),
];

// ...
// âœ¨ Here is the place where the magic happens in your App âœ¨
// ...

// Removing the memory cache only for `#24639C`
// It means that `#FF0000` is still cached.
// It's quite handy in scenarios of colors that are called for several times,
// Having other ones called twice or thrice
clearCache('#24639C');

// Or you can just remove all cached values from memory
// by calling the function with no arguments
clearCache();

// `fifthResult` and `sixthResult` will/won't be computed again based on `clearCache` usage
const [fifthResult, sixthResult] = [
  hexToCSSFilter('#24639C', { forceFilterRecalculation: false } as HexToCssConfiguration),
  hexToCSSFilter('#FF0000', { forceFilterRecalculation: false } as HexToCssConfiguration),
];
```

## [4.0.0][] - 2021-05-09

### Updated

- Updating the project dependencies and devDependencies to the latest version
- Decreasing package bundle size

## [3.1.2][] - 2020-07-24

### Fixed

- Fixing UMD bundle by using Rollup. Typescript was required in the package and one of the TS functions is required in the bundle.

## [3.1.1][] - 2020-06-29

### Updated

- Updating package dependencies and devDependencies to the latest

## [3.1.0][] - 2020-06-29

### Added

- Adding boolean `cache` field into the `hexToCSSFilter()` payload;
- Adding
  ynew configuration option: `forceFilterRecalculation`. It's a boolean value that forces recalculation for CSS filter generation. Default: `false`;

### Fixed

- Fixing color generation using `maxTriesInLoop` to get the optimal color for the CSS filter

## [3.0.1][] - 2020-06-28

### Updated

- Increasing `maxChecks` from 15 to 30
- Adding private methods in classes
- Improving internal types
- Removing `any` from codebase

## [3.0.0][] - 2020-06-25

### Fixed

- CSS Filter working properly when receives `#FFF` color;
- Fixed internal issue on `hexToRgb` method when receiving `#FFF` and `#000` colors

### Updated

- Breaking change: `HexToCssConfiguration` type now is using `acceptanceLossPercentage` instead of `acceptableLossPercentage`

```
-  acceptableLossPercentage?: number;
+  acceptanceLossPercentage?: number;
```

- Better types for internal methods
- Improving package documentation
- Adding documentation for consumers to use `#000` as a container background on `README.md`

## [2.0.4][] - 2020-04-24

### Fixed

- `Solver`: Changing default target color to be white or black, based on the
  given color. It solves the issue when a color is darker and the returned CSS filter resolutions is incorrect.

## [2.0.3][] - 2020-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixing bundle size
- Setting the filter to white to take effect properly. Closes https://github.com/willmendesneto/hex-to-css-filter/issues/7

Since `Solver` is forcing the stored instance of `color` to be white in rgb, the brightness should be white as well. That
means the filter is based on white, so it needs to set the filter to white to take effect.

https://github.com/willmendesneto/hex-to-css-filter/blob/996d0c78ba275b7c16ae3d87821dd044276db563/src/solver.ts#L136

E.G.

```diff
- filter: invert(39%) sepia(91%) saturate(4225%) hue-rotate(162deg) brightness(95%) contrast(101%);
+ filter: brightness(0) invert(1) invert(39%) sepia(91%) saturate(4225%) hue-rotate(162deg) brightness(95%) contrast(101%);
```
